# Project Title

    Rubik cube Solver  

## Project Overview

    this project allow user to play with 3D rubic cube with Random input and  will focus on AI by learning our BOT to detect a Rubik Cube by Input method and give the solution for the Cube.

## problem domain

    - a smart game that improve the memory and the way you think, it requires a series of
     movement sequences, or algorithms, in order to be
     solved.
    - The solver should match each side of the cube with
     same colors of squares.
    - Rubik’s Cube consists of:
      - 26 small cubes that rotate on
        a central axis;
      - nine coloured cube faces, in three rows
        of three from each side of the cube.
    - When the cube is twisted out of its original arrangement, the
        player must then return it to the original
    - configuration—one among 43 quintillion possible ones

## Technologies Used

    - numpy
    - ursina :  game engine
    - LITE SQL
    - OpenCV
    - Kociemba algorithm

## Features

    - create interactive interface
    - connect to DB to save cube state
    - open camera to take photo
    - using AI to build model to learn and teach how to solve the cube

## How to use the app

    1. the user first can play with 3D model Rubik’s Cube with all of the basic movements (Front, Back, Top, Bottom, Left and Right).
    2. the second part is going to take input from the camera and translate each side, extract colors of the squares with the positions
    3. give the steps to solve the cube.
