# Social Media Manager Scraper and Bot with Analytics Dashboard (using Selenium and Plotly)

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a social media management tool using Selenium, a web automation framework. The tool will provide functionalities for scraping data from social media platforms, automating interactions, and generating analytics reports.

## Features
- **Data Scraping**: The tool will use Selenium to scrape data from various social media platforms, including user profiles, posts, comments, and engagement metrics.
